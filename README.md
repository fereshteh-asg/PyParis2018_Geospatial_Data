# PyParis2018_Geospatial_Data
This repository contains the presentation file with the jupyter notebook that I used for my tutorial in PyParis2018

Data directry contains all the data files that are imported in jupyter notebook except the hubway_trips data which was too large to be uploaded in github.
You just need to download the data and copy it in the hubway_2011_07_through_2013_11 directory
